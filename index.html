  <p>
    I am a Christian who believes all Christians should be able access Church,
    other Christians and Christian resources 24/7 despite their situation,
    such as work, disability’s or having to care for someone,
    there are many situations which lead to people of faith not being
    able to access a physical Church and sadly in most cases these people
    will receive no support from there local church’s, so having a place to
    request prayer and other supportive fellowship is vital for Gods people.

    <h3> What we are about.</h3>
    <br />
  </center>


  <p> Gods Church online is a family friendly environment, so no inappropriate
    content of any kind such as language, images, intolerance or
    abuse will be tolerated, here we accept Jesus Christ as our lord
    and saviour and believe in the trinity and the teachings of Jesus Christ.
  </p>
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>Gods Church Online is not on social media. (facebook, twitter, ect )
      any such group found is not associated with us and we take
      no responsibility for them.


    </li>
    <br />

    <li>
      Denominations of Christianity are as many as thirty to forty thousand,
      so some Christians here will have theological differences,
      please agree to disagree, as you will have far more in common
      (such as Jesus Christ being your lord and saviour,
      the trinity and the teachings of Christ )

    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      We remind all Members to follow the greatest commandments taught,
      Matt.22 V 37-40. Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love
      the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all
      thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like
      unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two
      commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

    </li>

  </ul>
